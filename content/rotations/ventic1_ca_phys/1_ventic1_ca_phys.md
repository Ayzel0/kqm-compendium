# **Notes**

This team is one of the fastest at speedrunning Carpal Tunnel syndrome in the game. Joking aside, this is a team that uses CA aim cancels to deal high amounts of single target physical damage. The amount of damage you deal scales directly with how many CAs you are able to shoot per second. While the team can be played without cancels, damage will suffer greatly. ARCC spam is optimal but extremely difficult and painful, so hold M1 spam (holding and releasing left click) is the recommended alternative.

Venti Burst is optional as this team is mostly single target damage, but it can be used to help with Energy and crowd control, as well as a little AoE damage and grouping for Rosaria Burst.
Venti can be replaced with another bow character if desired, such as Amber, Diona, Sara, etc.  

  
Energy Requirements:  
Venti: 140%
