  - Swirl
  - Sustain Damage
  - Tight Rotation
pros:
  - Anemo unit proccing transformative reactions besides Swirl
  - High constant healing compensating dodging mistakes
  - Excels in both AoE and single-target scenarios, with AoE being more forgivable with rotation mistakes
  - No need to start with full Energy. The first half of the rotation relies on Elemental Skills and NA/C only
cons:
  - Easily interruptible 
  - Tight rotation and Swirl windows to utilise to the fullest
  - Needs to memorize attack strings and usage of buffs with cooldowns
rotation:
  duration: 25s (with mistakes can make it about 30s)

# **Notes**
- The composition works without using Bennet and or Xingqiu with Xiangling, both really good supports for her.
- Long skill cooldowns makes it difficult to weave in one or another if the team lacks Energy, as doing this destroys the rotation.
- Healing off-field characters (Kokomi Q > NA/C) helps bringing people back to full for further chambers.
