pros:
  - Anemo unit proccing transformative reactions besides Swirl
  - High constant healing compensating dodging mistakes
  - Excels in both AoE and single-target scenarios, with AoE being more forgivable with rotation mistakes
  - No need to start with full Energy. The first half of the rotation relies on Elemental Skills and NA/C only
cons:
  - Easily interruptible 
  - Tight rotation and Swirl windows to utilise to the fullest
  - Needs to memorize attack strings and usage of buffs with cooldowns

# **Notes**
This rotation also assumes a c1 Sucrose with r1 Sac Frags in order to do two to three gooba swirls per rotation.  With c0 and r1 Sac Frags, or c1 and no Sac Frags you can do 2 instead of 3, one at each part of the rotation in order to keep up VV shred uptime for Pyronado.  If Xiangling isn't c4, then you don't have to worry about the gooba swirl near the end of the rotation as Pyronado will have ended anyways.
