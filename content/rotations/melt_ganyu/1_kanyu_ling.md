# **Notes**
Optional branches:  
- Can use Favonius weapons on Xiangling(should) and Kazuha  
- Ganyu can pick up Xiangling's A4 pepper while charging for +ATK%  
- Xiangling can use an artifact set for personal damage if wanted  
<br></br>
Some mistakes in the rotation are fine, only losing some damage or buffs in the process. However, not infusing Kazuha's Q with pyro is a BIG issue
<br></br>
Difficulty goes way down in Multi-target, as it's possible to get Cryo and Pyro buffs from Kazuha, from targets with different auras
<br></br>
-Personal notes: Did a lot of testing trying to get "Xiangling EQ > Kazuha" to swirl Cryo with a lot of fast cryo apps (Ganyu's and Diona's Q + Flower bloom) but couldn't. Could be timing issues or it's just so difficult that it isn't worth doing
<br></br>
Approximate Energy Requirements (only Diona using fav):
Ganyu: 130%  
Diona: 260% (if funneling) 
Kazuha: 210%
Xiangling: 320%
