# **Notes**

In this team, Xiangling is the main damage dealer, consistently serving as the trigger for Vaporize and Overload due to the constant elemental applications of Xingqiu and Raiden Burst. This is one of Raiden's more popular teams due to its strong performance relative to its ease of use. Players simply need to cast Xiangling Burst while within Bennett Burst for this team to perform well. To increase damage further, players can weave in Normal Attacks between each ability cast. Xingqiu's burst triggers early during the Normal Attack animation, allowing players to cancel their Normal Attacks before they hit and still trigger a wave at the cost of very little time. This is known as an N0 cancel. If this is too difficult, N1s can be used instead for similar results.
<br></br>
This team excels in single target content. In AoE, Overloads can launch mob enemies out of range of attacks, and Xiangling's Burst will not vape on enemies that aren't hit by Xingqiu's burst.
