# **Notes**
This team uses some of the best buffers in the game to buff Raiden's damage, making her a very potent hypercarry. Players should ensure Raiden's initial skill hits an enemy to establish an Electro aura, and prioritize infusing Kazuha's burst with pyro in content where enemies won't get knocked away as it's a strong source of damage. Kazuha's skill can be used earlier in the rotation if grouping is necessary. This team's main drawback is relying on staying inside Kazuha's Burst and Bennett's field to reach its highest damage potential, which may be a problem in case of mobile enemies like rifthounds or multi-waved content.
