## Rationale
Some units scale better or worse than others, and the KQMS should have the ability to standardize such calcs. Units like <a href="https://compendium.keqingmains.com/ayaka_shenhe_freeze
"><span style="color: #EDAFB8;">Ayaka contribute over 70%</span></a> of the damage output of a team, and players do not typically invest fully into the 3 other units that buff their carry. Therefore, the KQMS should have alternative, optional investment profiles for calculations.

Allocation Notation: (Distributed, static, cap increase per unshared mainstat)

**KQMS:**  
(20, 2, 2n)x4
- Distribute 20 substats. 2 flat substats into each stat. Cap for a specific substat is 10 - (2*number of same stat, main stat artifacts). Kazuha has a cap of 6 EM distributed subs with 3xEM artifacts.

**Hyper-invest:**  
(25, 2, 3n)x1  
(10, 3, 2n)x3

**Low-invest:**  
(20, 2, 2n)x1  
(10, 2, 2n)x3

**Questions:**
- Does providing these additional allocations properly represent investment?
- Is there a qualitative difference between the new allocations and the KQMS?
