## Rationale
Some characters run a mix of 4-Star and 5-Star artifacts such as 4-piece Instructors, where many units will use a 5-Star Energy Recharge timepiece to have enough Energy Recharge to Burst consistently.

## Status: <span style="color: #FFDB7D;">Proposed</span> - Vlad
To account for the fact that substat values are not strictly supposed to be 0.8x because you can have one 5-star artifact is to take an average based on the number of 5- and 4-Star artifacts you have and adjust the artifact stat scalar.
- If you have one 5-Star artifact and four 4-Star artifacts, the sub multiplier would be (1 + 0.8 * 4)/5 = 0.84x
