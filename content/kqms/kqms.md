## Definitions
- **Fixed substats**: rolls which are preallocated into all substats, including those which are not desirable
- **Distributed substats**: rolls which are distributed optimally within constraints

## Artifacts
- Artifact sets, stack assumptions if not calculated dynamically, mainstats, and energy requirements must be specified.
    - Energy requirements must be calculated with 3 clear orbs from enemies over 90s.
- All artifact pieces must be at maximum level.
- **20 fixed substats** should be distributed as 2 rolls of every substat.
- **20 distributed substats** should be distributed as optimally as can reasonably be achieved with the tools being used within the constraints given.
- Each substat type can have maximum 2 distributed substat rolls per artifact with a main stat that is of a different stat from it.
- 4* artifacts if used have a x0.8 stat modifier, and a penalty of -2 distributed substats per 4* artifact

The KQMS uses an average artifact substat scalar that is an average of the possible sub-stat rolls. There is a 0.8x penalty on 4-star stats.

### Example Distribution
![](/kqms/example_distribution.png)

## Weapons
- All weapons must be at LVL90.
- Weapon selection and refinement must be specified.
- Passive uptime assumptions must be specified (ie Lionâ€™s Roar Xingqiu 50% uptime).

## Constellations
- All constellations must be specified.

## Character and Talent Levels
- All characters must be LVL90/90 T9(+1)/9(+3)/9(+3).

## Rotation and Enemy Assumptions
- Damage must be calculated against LVL100 enemies with 10% universal resistance unless otherwise specified. 
- Any and all rotation assumptions must be specified. This includes but is not limited to:
    - Rotation length
    - Reaction uptime
    - Passive uptime
    - Buff durations
    - AoE Modifiers (if applicable)
    - Primary or single target damage must be listed somewhere if calcs are done with AoE modifiers.
- Map rotations to gameplay if possible with links to clips.
